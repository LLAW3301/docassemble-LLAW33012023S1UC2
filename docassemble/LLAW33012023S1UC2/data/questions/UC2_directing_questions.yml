      - It became hard to make payments on my loan after something happened that was foreseeable at the time of the loan.: irresponsible_direction3
        help: |
          Something is foreseeable if - when your lender investigated you - they could have predicted it would happen. For example, if you were pregnant it was foreseeable you would have to pay school fees in a few years. Another example, if you had a long-term disease, it was foreseeable you may stop being able to work.
          
      - It became hard to make my payments because something unexpected happened, changing my personal circumstances.: hardship_direction
        help: |
          Something is unexpected if - when your lender investigated you - they could not have predicted it would happen. For example, if you were a healthy person when you applied, with no medical history, it would be unexpected for you to develop a serious disease.
