  - Please select the option that sounds the most like you: issue_type
    datatype: radio
    choices:
      - It has always been hard to make the payments on my loan.: irresponsible_direction1
      - It only became hard to make payments on my loan after the interest only period finished: irresponsible_direction2
      - It became hard to make payments on my loan after something happened that was foreseeable at the time of the loan.: irresponsible_direction3
        help: |
          Something is foreseeable if it was expected. For example, if you were pregnant it was foreseeable you would have to pay school fees in a few years. Another example, if you had a long-term disease, it was foreseeable you may stop being able to work.
      - It became hard to make my payments because something unexpected happened, changing my personal circumstances.: hardship_direction
