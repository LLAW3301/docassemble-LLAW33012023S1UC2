  Welcome to the Uniting Communities Consumer Credit Law Centre of South Australia's Preliminary Loan Inspector application. 
  
  This web application is designed for people in Australia who are struggling to repay a loan - if that is not you please press exit.
  
  You will be asked a series of questions with the aim of identifying whether you may be dealing with a responsible lending issue.
  
  Lenders have an obligation to not give loans that are unsuitable, and so you may be able to be placed back in the position you were in before being given the loan. It is the lender's responsibility to make reasonable inquires into your circumstances.
  
  *Disclaimer*
  This application does not offer legal advice

  It may also be useful to request from your bank a copy of the assessment required under section 129 of the *National Consumer Credit Protection Act* and to bring this with you to seek legal advice. As it is the lender's responsibility to make reasonable inquires into your circumstances, deficiencies in this assessment support the possibility that you may be experiencing a responsible lending issue.
