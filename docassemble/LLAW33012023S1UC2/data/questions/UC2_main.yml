  dealing with an Irresponsible Lending Issue, you need to seek legal help. 
  [The Consumer Credit Law Centre of South Australia](https://www.unitingcommunities.org/service/legal-services/consumer-credit) may be able to provide help if you are located in South Australia. 
  
  
  It may be useful to request from your bank a copy of the assessment required under section 129 of the *National Consumer Credit Protection Act* and to bring this with you to seek legal advice. As it is the lender’s responsibility to make reasonable inquiries into your circumstances, deficiencies in this assessment support the possibility that you may be experiencing a responsible lending issue. Ask your lender for a copy of a paper called "section 129 assessment" and take it with you to get advice from a lawyer. If your lender did not provide enough consideration to your situation, you might have a problem with how they lent you money.
